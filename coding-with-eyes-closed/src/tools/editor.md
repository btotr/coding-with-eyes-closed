# What's the most accessible editor?

We learned that the terminal is not as accessible as we hoped.
The best thing to do is look for a graphical application.

Start basic. Just something that can modify a ```.txt``` file. 
Why? Because reading code is in the beginning hard enough. 
It can be microsoft Word if that is something you're used to. 
Just paste a piece of code into a editor you like and try to understand what is going on.
Make sure that line-wrap is turned off. It does not matter if the text is not visable because we hear the text.

When people ask to me what it is like to code with eyes closed, I tell them that it is like using your IDE but only seeing 1 line at a time.
This seems almost impossible but believe me, you can be productive with this limitation.

Install a few different editors and experiment along with the exercises later on in the book.

Your editor should have at least the following:

- Intergration with your VSC such as git
- Many shortcuts
- Quickly switching between files
- Accessible intergration with language servers.


I like [vscodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), but I wrote this in 2023 so my recommandation will probably soon be outdated.
