# What's the most accessible editor?

We learned that the terminal is not as accessible as we hoped.
The best thing to do is look for a graphical application.

Start basic. Just something that can modify a ```.txt``` file. 
Why? Because reading code is in the beginning hard enough. 
It can be microsoft Word if that is something you're used to. 
Just paste a piece of code into a editor you like and try to understand what is going on.
Make sure that line-wrap is turned off. It does not matter if the text is not visable because we hear the text.

When people ask to me what it is like to code with eyes closed, I tell them that it is like using your IDE but only seeing 1 line at a time.
This seems almost impossible but believe me, you can be productive with this limitation.

Install a few different editors and experiment along with the exercises later on in the book.

Your editor should have at least the following:


- Accessible intergration with language servers.
- Many shortcuts
- Intergration with git 

I will cover these three aspects in detail.

### Accessible intergration with language servers

//TODO; Explain what a language server is

A language server is extra important to us.
It is hard for visually impaired person to scan quickly through a document.
People with sight see a large file, 100 lines on one screen and see exactly where the function is that they are looking for
We do not have that super power, but we can work around it with language servers.

### Many shortcuts

### Intergration with git

This is usefull because terminals are not so accessible.
If you have a way to work with git such as with github desktop, you do not need this. 

I like [vscodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), but I wrote this in 2023 so my recommandation will probably soon be outdated.
