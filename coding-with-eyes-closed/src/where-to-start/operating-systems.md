# Operating systems

**chapter should be rewritten**

_linux can be used via ssh with a macos terminal**

You probably already have a favorite operating system, that is fine. 
I am going to give you advice from an accessibility standpoint.

If you are starting out, you are learning allot. My advice is to take the easiest result, and switch when you need it for a project.
Linux is for a whole lot of reasons useful. Fast, a good shell, open-source. Just to name a few.
But most visually impaird people use windows. I am not talking about developers, just people in general, the people who do not know that they are even using windows.
If something is wrong with an app, you will not be alone on windows.

If you are an arch linux unstable on arm64 and a vim-based screen reader, a tiling window manager and you cannot read your email anymore... good luck,. You have to figure it out yourself.

My advice is to use the most popular option for VIP. (visually impaired person/people)
If you become better and using you tools, you can consider switching to linux for example.

first you should be able to write a program, if you succeed, consider switch tools and test if it works for you.

So back to operating systems, here's a overview of what I think of each operating system from a accessibility standpoint.


### Windows

##### Pros

- allot of users
- most applications are accessible out of the box
- popular screen reader options

##### Cons

- Bad shell
- Blue screens
- Closed source


### MacOS

##### Pros

- VoiceOver is fast to use and easy to pick up, especially if you  know how VoiceOver works on iPhone.
- Almost all apple products are accessible
- A terminal that works with VoiceOver
- VoiceOver is on every mac


##### Cons

- you need a mac
- closed source

##### Linux

Their are allot of linux distributions, some of which focus on accessibility, I've never used a linux distro with no sight, because I could not set it up on my own.
I do not know much about Linux from an accessibility standpoint.

If you can work with it, use it. 
I believe Linux has the best tooling for developers and it can run Nix, you will see later on why this is useful.


### What do I use?

I use MacOS with Nix darwin as my package manager and build system.
VoiceOver is easy to pickup and I have a terminal.

I recommend starting out with windows or if you can effort it MacOS.
You can always try Linux after you wrote you first application with your eyes closed.


Next up, lets talk about screen readers!
