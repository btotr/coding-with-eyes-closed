# The compiler is your sight

This chapter is written all around 1 idea. **The compiler is your sight**.

I will explain why the compiler is so important if you're coding with eyes closed.

We have a big limitation. We can only read 1 line at a time. If you have partial sight maybe 3 lines at a time.
This is what makes coding with eyes closed very hard.
The trick is to not use that sight to search for erros.
The compiler should search for erros.

This ideas is not new at all, but many coders do not listen to this advice at all.
As I'm wrting this, the 2 most populair programming languages are javascript and python.
Neither of these languages implement this idea well enough.
