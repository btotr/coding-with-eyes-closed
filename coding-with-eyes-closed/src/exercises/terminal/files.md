# Navigating your files

Goal: Use a terminal with basic commands.

## Intro

Terminal is hard. It is not for everyone.
We learned that using a terminal is harder when you have a visual impairment.
Still, their are some situations where you cannot avoid it.

This exercise is mainly for getting more familiar with the new nature of using a terminal.

## The mission

You are only allow to use the terminal. No gui.

1. Create a folder named ```folder-a```

2. Create a file in ```folder-a``` called ```file-a.txt``` that contains the sentence: ```I am a file. Nice to meat you!```.
Tip, you do not have to use an editor in the terminal such as vim or nano. You can use the ```echo command```

3. Copy ```file-a.txt``` and name it ```file-b.txt```. Make sure that ```file-b.txt``` is in ```folder-a```. Use the ```cp``` command.

4. Copy ```folder-a``` with all the files and name it ```folder-b```. Use the ```cp``` command.

Tip, you can read man-pages online with your screen reader instead of in the terminal.

Good luck.
