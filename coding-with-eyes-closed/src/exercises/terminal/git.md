# git init

Goal: Use the git cli.

## Intro

Sometimes, you want to use the git cli instead of a gui.

## The mission

1. Init a git repository.

2. Make a commit with changes and a commit meesage.

3. Push your changes to a remote using your terminal. 
If you do not have ssh configured, you should make a privaste and public ssh-key.

Good luck!
