# Hello syntax!

goal: Get you femiliar with syntax and screenreaders.

## Intro

Reading a program can be a bit hard.
Sighted coders can see in a glance what is happening. 
Visually impaired coders can only see / hear 1 line at a time.

First, we need to get familair with this new way of looking at a file.

## The mission

1. Download an editor that fits you.
You can read the editors section for recomendations.

2. Make an HTML file and paste some html in the file or write it yourself.
Look around in the file with your screenreader. Do you know in which scope you are? When a html tag begins and when it ends? 

Good luck!
