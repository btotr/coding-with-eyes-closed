# Introduction

Coding with eyes closed is for people who recently became blind or visually impaired and would like to code.
This is not a tutorial on how to code. You already now how to write a program, but you're too inexperienced with coding with screen readers to do so.
The goal of this book is to get you up and running again, and hopefolly get back to work. 

Coding with eyes closed is possible. It is hard, really hard, but not impossible. 
I've made a website using typescript and a reproducable build system with Nix, CI/CD with github actions and merged pull requests in various open source projects all without reading a single character. Everything with only the use of text to speech and a little bit of braille.

It is a hard journey and you should lower your expectations about your skills. You may be the best programmer on earth, but in the first few months, your inexperience with screen readers will limit you in creating the most beautiful applications.
I believe that if you like to code, you can do this.

This book is meant for people who depend on screen reader and text-to-speach (TTS) technology.
It has useful elements for people with partial sight, but it is mostly meant for people who have little to no vision.
I believe that how people with partial sight use technology comes closer to how a visual person would use technology.
If you come from a sighted world and now depend on TTS, programming is way harder dan working with magnifications for example. 

I can now use my sight with with magnifications, but programming with little to no sight made me a better programmer, because I had to be really careful where I had to put my functions, which made me better at thinking about separation of concern.

This book is highly opinionated. 
I will give advice based on my own experiences with my use of TTS technology.
I had little to no sight between 2021 and 2023. 
The accessibility field is moving fast and my recommendations regarding tooling will someday be outdated. It contains recommendations about tooling, but also tips that are still useful 20 years from now.
The book also contains exercises, to get you up and running.

It is meant to be read from beginning to end. 
I've put allot of time in this book, so if you find this useful, please consider starring [the repository](https://github.com/sempruijs/coding-with-eyes-closed) so I know you liked it :)
